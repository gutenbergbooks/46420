<p>The Comedy of “M<span class="smallerfont">ARRIED</span> L<span
class="smallerfont">IFE</span>” is <i>entirely</i> original—if the being unassisted by
either anecdote, tale, ballad, biography, or any other resource constitutes <i>entire
originality</i>.—Yet, as some of the couples, especially M<span
class="smallerfont">R</span>. and M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. C<span
class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span>, and M<span class="smallerfont">R</span>. and M<span
class="smallerfont">RS</span>. D<span class="smallerfont">OVE</span>, have been
“<i>sketched from the life</i>,” the important question of originality is still open to
much disquisition.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to dedicate this Comedy to you, as some
little token of my very great admiration of your talents. It is a very common cant to
allow of no existing excellence, and refer only to the past for instances of genius! In
Dramatic matters, this cant has been particularly cherished; but, with reference to
yourself, it may be presumed that were a playgoer of Cibber’s time now in existence, he
would be puzzled, with all his fond recollections, to name few, if any, by-gone
<i>artistes</i> who could have borne away one feather from your well-filled cap of fame.
And truly the actor of the U<span class="smallerfont">NCLES</span> F<span
class="smallerfont">OOZLE</span> and J<span class="smallerfont">OHN</span>—of the Lawyers
G<span class="smallerfont">ROTIUS</span> and F<span class="smallerfont">LAM</span>—of the
wily S<span class="smallerfont">TEWARD</span>—of the cold and crafty Diplomatist, C<span
class="smallerfont">OUNT</span> B<span class="smallerfont">ERTRAND</span>—of the
physically cold S<span class="smallerfont">AMUEL</span> C<span
class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span>—the excellent and kind-hearted M<span
class="smallerfont">ICHEL</span> P<span class="smallerfont">ERRIN</span>—of the warlike
C<span class="smallerfont">HARLES THE</span> T<span class="smallerfont">WELFTH</span>—of
S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> P<span class="smallerfont">ETER</span> and O<span
class="smallerfont">GLEBY</span>—and fifty other triumphant assumptions, must possess a
feathered coronet of no ordinary dimensions. With a hundred thanks for your great
attention to every humble effort of mine, in which you have been concerned, and for the
anxiety that you have always shewn for my success, permit me to wish you many years of
health and strength, that the stage may long be enabled to name you with pride and
pleasure as one of its greatest ornaments.</p>

matrimonial squabble. It appears that the wife of the complainant is a woman of violent

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> What did I do?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> You told her, in my presence, that she was very
pretty.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Was there any sin in that?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> ’Twas not only a very great familiarity on your
part, sir—but a want of respect for me.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> True—’twas wrong in me to forget that few women can
endure to hear another admired.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> And few men think their wives to be possessed of any
superior charms to the first doll they may meet.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Excellent, indeed—my love, we must turn authors; and

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> I think the last time we walked out with Mr. and
Mrs. Coddle, that you might have offered me your arm, and not have left me to the care of
the husband, while you flirted with the wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> What do you call flirting?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> Whispering—laughing—and affecting to have,—or really

truth.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> You were not at home on that evening—indeed, I don’t
know when you <i>are</i> at home; always out—always running about—calling on this lady,
and meeting that—receiving notes of assignation, and—but I’ll not endure it longer, Mr.
Lynx—you may provoke me beyond the bounds of endurance, and then beware—</p>

and true husband do under such circumstances? Show the letter to his wife. Will he do
that? If he does, I will freely forgive—forget—and think all that I have heard and seen to

my life.</p>

I was obliged to turn my whole body thus. If any one spoke to me on my right, I could only
attend to them by pivotting so. If I wished to see what was going on behind me, I was
obliged to whirl round like a<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> You’ll suffocate me some day, Coddle—I know you
will. You don’t know what a life I lead with him, Mrs. Lynx—five blankets in July—think

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Highly necessary—we are more liable to take cold in hot
weather, than in any other. I always have four colds, one rheumatism, and two stiff necks
every July.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> What d’ye think he did a week ago, Mrs. Lynx? I had
retired early: in the middle of the night I awoke in such a state of alarm—I really
thought the room beneath us was on fire—the air of my apartment was so hot, so sultry,
that I could not draw my breath. I gasped for air; What can be the matter, I said to
myself? Surely I’ve been suddenly transported to the Indies, and there is a thunder-storm
brewing. I rose—I opened the windows—</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And almost killed me on the spot; there was a strong
north wind blowing at that moment—enough to wither one.—Imprudent woman.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> ’Twas a fine bracing night breeze—but out of
kindness to Coddle, I immediately closed the windows—Phew. Oh, gracious, had you but have
felt the heat—I fainted away in the easy chair—Coddle rang the bell—the servants came—and
to my horror, we discovered that Coddle had clandestinely introduced a German stove into
the bed-room, and there it was, red hot. Think what a person of my temperament must have
endured. I’ve been ill ever since.</p>

about—and go into a fury now and then—I should be the happiest woman in the world; but he

contradicted me, as you always do.</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> Allow me to tell Mrs. Lynx—you must know, madam, that
some years ago, my wife was sent to the boarding-school of Mrs. Dove, in Sussex.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Dove—when she informed us that she had given up her school, and was now in
London for the purpose of collecting some old debts, and amongst the names of the persons
that she had to call on, was that of a Mr. Lynx——</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> Louisa, how can you? why will you thus agitate Mrs.
Lynx?—you are not sure the Mr. Lynx, that Mrs. Dove is looking for, is the husband of our
friend—we merely surmised that it was.</p>

dreadful suspense—think of my feelings at this moment.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Y.</span> Mrs. Dove is now below, with her husband; shall I ask
her to walk up?—then she can relate this strange circumstance herself.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Lynx.</span> Yes, yes—pray tell me.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Y.</span> Well, then—Mrs. Dove, you must know, was a widow; and
formerly the mistress of a large boarding school; but has now retired, after marrying her
footman. They are the oddest couple you ever met with. She is perpetually drilling her
husband into politeness and correct pronunciation, which the poor man will never
comprehend as long as he lives. Oh, had you but seen them last night! whenever a bell
rang, poor Mr. Dove could scarcely help starting from his chair, and running to attend to
it; and could only be checked by the alarming eyes of Mrs. Dove. Ha! ha!—Oh, those<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> eyes—how they did
remind me of my school-days! just the looks that she used to dart at us, poor refractory
girls.</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> My dear, why don’t you keep to that portion of the
narrative, most interesting to Mrs. Lynx; she don’t want to hear of great eyes and
refractory girls.</p>

<p class="scene"><i>An Apartment in the house of </i>M<span class="smallerfont">R</span>.
C<span class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span>;<i> windows at the back with curtains; the doors
are edged with list and leather. Table and chairs; an easy chair in the centre of the
stage; </i>M<span class="smallerfont">RS</span>. C<span
class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span><i> discovered at the table, a note in her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> How very odd! how very strange! though this note
arrived last night, I have scarcely done anything since but read it.—(<i>Reads.</i>)—“My
dear Mrs. Coddle, pray pardon the warmth of my temper that led me to use certain
expressions to you, of which, at the time, I was not conscious—though now, on recollection
of them, I express my sorrow. Forgive me, and dine with us at five to-morrow, do not
dissappoint me on your life, as I have a strong reason for inviting you; bring Coddle with
you, of course. Sincerely yours, Emmeline Lynx.” What a strange woman! who would suppose,
that yesterday, she desired me to quit the house and never enter there again. Well, I’m
resolved to go. What a length of time Coddle takes for dressing; ’tis now half-past four,
and I have been ready this hour.—(<i>She knocks at <span
class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">D</span>.</i>)—Coddle, you drone, make haste.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> (<i>Within.</i>)—I shall be ready immediately—I am now
putting on my fourth waistcoat.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> And he wears <i>six</i>—how the man can exist in
such a state, I know not; and what is the matter with him, I am equally at a loss to
guess; he has been overpowered with nervous agitation, and in a high fever all the
morning—has been talking in his sleep all night. I could only catch the words “Dont,—I’ll
say any thing—declare any thing—but don’t;”—the man has something on his mind—what can it
be?—He surely can’t have committed any crime—a robbery, nor a murder?—oh, the monster! I
must question him.—(<i>Enter </i>C<span class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span>,<i> <span

better?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Not much—I feel very faint.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Give me your hand.—(C<span
class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span><i> presents his hand timidly.</i>)—Dear—dear—what a
burning fever you are in—your hands are like live coals; and what a pulse.—(<i>Feeling his
pulse.</i>)—Heaven’s, Samuel!—you are ill!</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I am.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> And the cause is not so much bodily infirmity as
mental anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Lord!—do you—do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> You are fainting—let me open the windows.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> No—no—not for worlds.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> What has caused this fever?</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I—I—don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Coddle, your mind is diseased.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> My dear, don’t speak to me in that fierce manner, you
make me tremble from head to foot.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> You pass’d a wretched night.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> You talk’d in your sleep.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> No!—(<i>Alarmed.</i>)—Did I—what did I say?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Sufficient to rouse my suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I have been criminating myself—’twas while I was
dreaming of being hanged.—(<i>Aside.</i>)—What <i>will</i> become of me?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Tell me—what is this matter that has so suddenly
disconcerted you?</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Ah—she don’t know—I breathe again.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Answer me, Sir; what have you done?</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I—I—left off my life-preserving under-waistcoat,
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Base equivocator—you shall have no rest, depend
upon it, till I am perfectly acquainted with the cause of your agitation. I have watched
your actions, Sir, more than you are aware of; ’tis something in which Mr. Lynx is
concerned;<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-32">[Pg 32]</a></span> I
observed you, when you returned from his house yesterday, you came home quite an altered
man—you that were not to be roused by any thing that did not interfere with your own
immediate comfort, seemed suddenly to have changed your nature: the servant left your room
door open, unchecked; a broken pane close to your ear escaped your notice—you ate no
supper—you ordered no fire in your bed-room—and your sleep was disturbed by sighs and
groans, and words of guilt.—Ha!—I have made you tremble—now, Sir, I shall leave you, and
in the meantime you will do well to prepare for a confession that I am resolved to wring
from you.—(<i>Aside.</i>)—I have shaken him from his lethargy at last.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I am a lost man—I knew my day of reckoning would arrive.
Mary suspects something, that’s clear—um!—and I’m going out to dinner too—what a dinner it
will be to me; it must be a feast of poison, and a flow of woe—if my secret is preserved,
my promise to Lynx must lead to a commotion.—Who can this girl be that I undertake to own?
Ha! ha!—now I think of it, I am safe; he <i>dare</i> not betray me, he is as much in
<i>my</i> power as I am in <i>his</i>—yet how could he have discovered my unhappy
situation? He won’t acknowledge that. No—no; he considers that mystery adds to his strong
hold upon me. I have borrowed a book of criminal jurisprudence, from my attorney.—I want
to learn the utmost penalty of the law for my offence.—(<i>He takes a book from his pocket
and turns over the leaves.</i>)—Here it is—bigamy!—(<i>Reads.</i>)—“If guilty,”—what?
“<i>transportation for life.</i>” Oh!—(<i>Falling in a chair.</i>)—Think of my being at
Botany Bay—working night and day—summer and winter—in trousers without lining—only a shirt
on my back—and a chain round my leg; no umbrella to put up when it rains, no such thing as
a yard of Welch flannel within a thousand miles of me, and nothing aired for me—I should
die—the first damp night would send me to the tomb of the
Coddles—oh!—(<i>Shuddering.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Who can that be? I told the woman of the house on no
account to admit a soul, or to tell any one who had taken her rooms; but if she should be
obliged to confess, to give out that a half-crazy gentleman occupies them, who will not
allow a creature to approach him but herself. I think I am safe here, nobody knows me;
I’ve changed my name, I have paid a month’s rent in advance, have closed and fastened the
shutters and door, and intend to live in future by candle-light; so here I am
alone—(<i>Sitting in a chair.</i>)—with two wives claiming me, yet alone, that’s
something. What a night I have passed! One minute trembling with apprehension, the next
with cold; the loose windows rattling all night like the chains of a sleepless
felon—nothing but draughts all over the room, and a corner house too, its edges worn away
by the wind constantly whistling round it—ugh!—(<i>Shuddering—A knocking heard <span

was asleep, no doubt, so wouldn’t disturb me; how cold I am, there is a terrible wind
somewhere. This is the most miserable place I ever was in, in my life; where can that rush
of air come from? I must find<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg

stop every crevice.—(<i>He goes round the room with a lighted candle; he holds it before a
crevice in the flat; the flame of the candle waves.</i>)—Ah, here’s the place—a thorough
draught, enough to kill me.—(<i>The candle goes out.</i>)—It has blown the candle out;
what a horrid place!—(<i>He hammers some tow into the crevice; while thus employed, a

I answer? I will—I must—this suspense will drive me mad—who—who’s there?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> (<i>Without.</i>)—My dear fellow, open the door.</p>

no reply; you are as difficult to come at as a grand sultan.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> I am a grand sultan, I rejoice in a plurality of wives.
Oh, that Turkey, what a blessed country! where bigamy is a virtue, and a man’s
consequences is rated not by the number of voices he can command in a parliament, but by
the number of wives he can command at home. But tell me, how did you discover my
retreat?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> You certainly could not expect to remain here

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> The woman of the house gave me your whole history, when

Dismal, I have left at the door.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Which do you think the easiest method of quitting
life?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Quitting life!</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Aye, of committing suicide?—hanging, poisoning,
suffocation, drowning, or the pistol? For to one of these escapes from my terrors, I am
determined to apply.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Then you have not seen your wife?</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Which?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Your second.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Not since we parted at your house yesterday. I can never
face her again. How is Mrs. Lynx?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> She has left me.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Left you!</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> I am now in search of her, for this morning I have
received intelligence that leaves me at liberty to confess more respecting that girl, than
I have hitherto dared to tell.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> That girl? my adopted daughter, you mean?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> I do; to this alone is my wife indebted for my seeking
her. I would rather have died, than have been the first to advance one step towards a
reconciliation, after her deliberate attempt yesterday at publicly exposing me.—(<i>A
knock heard again at <span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span

that of the whole party of married people that sat down to my table yesterday, not one

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> They found my example so very pleasant, I suppose, they
could not resist following it.—(<i>Knocking again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> (<i>Without.</i>)—Open the door, we wish to see
you.—(L<span class="smallerfont">YNX</span> <i>unbolts the door; </i>Y<span

<p><span class="name">Dis.</span> Mr. Dove is below, and wants to see you.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> He sha’nt come in, I wont have any more visitors. I came
here to conceal myself, and here is my whole circle of acquaintance around me already;
well, sit down, sit down, as you <i>are</i> here.—(<i>they all sit</i>)—What poor unhappy
wretches we all are!</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> For my own part, I freely confess, that I never was
more miserable in all my days, and really begin to think that a wife is an indispensable
comfort.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Where you’ve but one. ’Tis a comfort so peculiarly
singular, that once pluralized, it is destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dis.</span> I had no idea that a restless night, by myself, could
have made me think so favourably of Mrs. Dismal.</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> Ah, my friends—absence, like death, leads us to dwell
on the better qualities of those that are away.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And the heart that can then but refer to faults, is one
of which we ought to be ashamed. If the second Mrs. Coddle had but consulted my comforts a
little more than she did, and not look’d for raptures and passions in one, who had them
not in his nature—she would have been a divinity.</p>

<p><span class="name">Young.</span> <i>My</i> wife’s great fault is her perpetual
proneness for contradiction; were she to qualify her opposition, by presuming that I
mistake, or by merely thinking that I am wrong, I should be satisfied, but her flat
contradictions on every subject are unbearable, and I won’t put up with it; she sometimes
makes me quite furious, zounds!</p>

<p><span class="name">Dis.</span> <i>My</i> wife’s great defect is her want of
cheerfulness; and expecting me every moment to be petting her like a Dutch<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-54">[Pg 54]</a></span> pug. I can’t fondle,
and be continually my dearing; my amiable moments are periodical.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> As she is not within, I shall look in again. I am
resolved to see her, for the more I reflect, the more I am incensed against my husband.

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Y.</span> I’m completely miserable—miserable.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> I went home, but Coddle never came near the house;
he has absconded, no doubt; I did not close my eyes all night.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Dove.</span> I have been in a state of perfect distraction
since my unhappy disagreement, with Henry—where <i>can</i> he have gone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Y.</span> I would not go to my aunt—I changed my mind, called
on Mrs. Dismal and sat up with her, I am determined not to return home till Frederick
fetches me; it <i>was</i> Uncle Tolloday that gave me the thimble.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Dis.</span> If you had not come to me, Mrs. Y., I should have
died before morning; as it is, Mr. D’s. cruel indifference has worn me to a shade.</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Cod.</span> Indifference! I am sure the apathy of my husband
was never equalled; I have flirted with a dozen young men in one evening, to excite him to
a little harmless jealousy, but in vain; and I really think, he would neither have
stirred, nor cared, had I eloped with three captains at once. And now to discover that he
has another wife! Oh, if I could see him again—I think I should assassinate him! a
monster! a—oh!—(<i>Sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Dis.</span> Just like my Dismal; when we go into company, he
always gets as far away from me as he can—never notices me—never smiles at me—never looks
as if he loved me. I—I—I am a very ill-used woman.—(<i>Sobbing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Y.</span> (<i>Sobbing.</i>)—Don’t weep, Mrs. Dismal; don’t
weep; I wont, if—if—I break my heart. Y. sha’n’t say that I ever dropped a tear at his

this must not be; what would our husbands say if they knew of our weakness? No, no—we must
not break our hearts for such creatures: we must rally and laugh. Ha! ha! ha!<span

laugh—and make your arrangements for the future with resolution and spirit. You, Mrs.
Lynx, will, I presume, for the present lodge here. I shall now step to my friends and
return in half an hour. Mrs. Dove, you are a sensible and well-educated woman; pray
accompany me, and give me your advice! we may hear of Mr. Dove while we are gone. Mrs. Y.,
you, of course, will stay with Mrs. Dismal for the present. Good bye, my dears—good bye!
Now pray, don’t fret; be women—be women—don’t weep about a man. What are men?—mere
self-elected law-makers. Don’t despair, ladies; the time is fast coming when <i>we</i>
shall have voices in the legislation of the country, and then let them look to their
questions. The wrongs done to our sex, for centuries, shall be well revenged in the first

Lynx, what did <i>you</i> marry for?</p>

<p><span class="name">Lynx.</span> I freely confess it was for love.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And you, Mrs. Lynx, married him from the same

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And you, Mr. and Mrs. Younghusband, married——</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And you, Mr. Dismal?</p>

<p><span class="name">Dis.</span> Because I was tired of living alone.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And Mrs.&nbsp;D. was weary of the same life, no
doubt?</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Dis.</span> I confess my weakness.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> And you, Mr. and Mrs. Dove, married—because——</p>

<p><span class="name">Mrs. Dove.</span> Being a widow, and accustomed to a sharer in my
joys and sorrows——</p>

<p><span class="name">Dove.</span> You took me into partnership, at my master’s
dissolution.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Well, then, whenever a disagreement breaks out among you
in future, recall the memory of those inducements which first led you to think of each
other, and you will find it to be a wonderful help to the restoration of peace. Do you all
agree to this?</p>

<p><span class="name">All.</span> Yes, yes.</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> Then follow my example, and ratify the agreement by a
hearty conjugal embrace; <i>I</i> will give the word of command. Make ready!—(<i>As
</i>C<span class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span><i> puts his arm round his wife’s waist, each
of the husbands do the same to their wives.</i>)—Present!—(C<span
class="smallerfont">ODDLE</span><i> takes his wife’s chin between his fingers and thumb,
and prepares to kiss her, all the husbands do the same.</i>)—Fire!—(<i>They all kiss and
embrace at the same moment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="name">Cod.</span> There, this is the way that all matrimonial quarrels
should end—and if <i>you</i> are of the same opinion—(<i>to the</i><span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-66">[Pg 66]</a></span> <i>audience</i>)—then,
indeed, will our conjugal joy be complete, and our light lesson not have been read in
vain. You have seen the result of perpetual jealousy, in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Lynx; of
continual disputes and contradiction in that of Mr. and Mrs. Younghusband; of a want of
cheerfulness and attention in Mr. and Mrs. Dismal; of the impolicy of public correction in
the instance of Mrs. Dove; and the necessity of assimilating habits and tempers in the
singular case of Mr. and Mrs. Coddle; and though these may not be one half the causes of
quarrel between man and wife—yet, even their exposure may serve as beacon lights, to avoid
the rocks of altercation when sailing on the sea of matrimony. So think of us, all ye
anticipating and smiling single people; for you <i>must</i>, or <i>ought</i>, all to be
married, and the sooner the better—and remember us ye already paired; and let our example
prove to you that to mutual forbearance, mutual confidence, mutual habits, mutual
everything, must we owe mutual happiness. And where can the <i>best</i> of happiness be
found, but in a loyal and affectionate Married Life?</p>

“will not” is spelled both “wont” and “won’t”, and “secrecy” is also spelled “secresy”.
Emendations were made to correct for minor printing problems.</p>

<p>The following changes were made to the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>For consistency, the formatting of names in stage directions has been standardized
throughout the text: small caps in the html version and all caps in the text version. The
abbreviations “Mr.” and “Mrs.” have been transcribed consistently with a period.</li>

<li>p. 11: <span class="name">Lynx.</span> (<i>Looking off, <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span> </i>)—They’re your friends, Mr.
and Mrs. Coddle—Inserted a period after “<span class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 17: <span class="name">Mrs. Ly.</span> (<i>Looking off, <span
class="stage">L</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>,</i>)—Who is this?—Changed the
comma after “<span class="stage">H</span>” to a period.</li>

<li>p. 18: <span class="name">Young</span> Allow me to tell Mrs. Lynx—Inserted a period
after “<span class="name">Young</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 23: <i>They approach the <span class="stage">L</span>&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span>. door</i>—Inserted a period after “<span
class="stage">L</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 24: (<i>she sinks into a chair </i>)—Inserted a period after “<i>chair</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 25: <span class="name">Young.</span> You shall uot—(<i>without.</i>)—Changed “uot”
to “not”.</li>

<li>p. 43: “The monster to whom you are married.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”—No attempt was made to
reproduce the convention in the source text of single quotation marks printed down the
left margin indicating that the text is part of a continuous quote.</li>

<li>p. 44: Ah, this door—(<i>pointing <span class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span
class="stage">H</span> </i>)—leads to the canal—Inserted a period after “<span
class="stage">R</span>.&nbsp;<span class="stage">H</span>”.</li>

<li>p. 52: <span class="name">Lynx.</span> I am not in search of her—Changed “not” to
“now”. In his next line, Lynx states he is seeking his wife to explain his relationship
with his niece, and thus “now” makes more sense. This change was also made in the American
edition published by Harold Roorbach in 1889, a digitized copy of which is posted at:</li>

<ul>
<li>p. 56: Tol de rol lol.—(<i>Dancing.</i>) You hear,—Inserted an em-dash after
“(<i>Dancing.</i>)” for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 56: receive your huband and his friend.—Changed “huband” to “husband”.</li>

<li>p. 57: the more I reflect, the more I am imcensed against my husband.—Changed
“imcensed” to “incensed”.</li>
